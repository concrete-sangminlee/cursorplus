## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Clipboard IPC now rejects oversized payloads before they cross the renderer/main-process boundary. Text writes are capped at 5 MiB, clipboard images are capped at 16 megapixels and 25 MiB after PNG encoding, and malformed clipboard payload shapes are rejected with explicit errors. Added 12 regression tests in `electron/ipc/clipboard-guard.test.ts`.
- Workspace opening now uses a dedicated `fs:open-workspace` IPC channel instead of overloading `fs:read-dir`. Only the new channel can validate and set the active workspace root; ordinary `fs:read-dir` calls are constrained to the current workspace and never mutate the root, removing the previous path-comparison heuristic that inferred caller intent.
- `terminal:create` now validates the renderer-supplied shell options shape before calling `pty.spawn()`. Custom shells remain supported, but `shellPath` must be a non-empty string without NUL/control characters and `shellArgs` must be an array of strings without NUL bytes, preventing malformed IPC payloads from escaping the documented terminal shell-selection contract. Added 13 regression tests in `electron/ipc/terminal-options-guard.test.ts`.
- `omo:start` no longer accepts an unused renderer-supplied project path. The OMO bridge never consumed that value, so the IPC contract now starts the assistant without letting a compromised renderer smuggle arbitrary path strings through an otherwise pathless initialization flow.
- `task:run`, `task:list-scripts`, and workspace settings IPC handlers now validate renderer-supplied cwd/root paths against the active workspace before spawning shells or reading/writing `.orion/settings.json`. `task:run` also rejects non-string or NUL-containing commands while preserving shell metacharacters, since running user-authored command lines through the configured shell is the task runner contract.
- Workspace path guard no longer re-stats the active workspace root on every `file:*` / `fs:*` IPC call. The directory-vs-file check now runs only through `resolveWorkspaceRootPath()` when opening or changing a workspace root, so hot operations such as file reads, watches, and existence checks avoid one extra disk hit per call while preserving the same root validation behavior.
- `fs:*` IPC handlers now reuse the active-workspace path guard introduced for `file:*`, and `fs:read-dir` validates that requested roots are existing absolute directories before building a tree. Reading a subdirectory inside the active workspace no longer narrows the active root, which prevents later operations on sibling folders from being accidentally rejected after breadcrumb or explorer browsing. Added 7 regression tests for workspace-root validation in `electron/ipc/workspace-path-guard.test.ts`.
- `file:*` IPC handlers (`rename`, `copy`, `move`, `stat`, `exists`, directory create/delete, watch, binary read) now require an active workspace root and validate every renderer-supplied path before touching the filesystem. The previous handlers passed arbitrary absolute paths directly into `fs`/`chokidar`, so a compromised renderer could read, write, move, watch, or delete outside the opened project via `..` traversal or sibling-prefix tricks. The new guard rejects relative, empty, non-string, and control-character paths, uses `path.relative()` containment instead of string-prefix checks, and resolves existing targets plus nearest existing parents to block symlink/junction escapes. Added 15 regression tests in `electron/ipc/workspace-path-guard.test.ts`.
- `shell.openPath()` IPC handler now validates the target path against an executable-extension blocklist (`.exe`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.ps1`, `.vbs`, `.msi`, `.sh`, `.app`, `.jar`, …). The handler previously forwarded any renderer-supplied string straight to the OS default-app launcher — a direct RCE primitive if a compromised IPC caller or prompt-injected AI tool output reached it. The new validator screens every dot-separated segment, so `invoice.pdf.exe` lookalikes are caught too. `showItemInFolder` gets a lighter check (NUL / control-char / non-string rejection) since revealing in the file manager does not execute the target. Added 14 regression tests in `shared/path-safety.test.ts`.
- `shell.openExternal()` IPC handler now refuses URLs outside an `http:` / `https:` / `mailto:` / `tel:` allowlist. Custom protocol schemes (`slack:`, `vscode:`, `ms-cxh:`, `steam:`, `zoommtg:`, …) resolve to OS-registered handlers that can launch arbitrary local applications — a classic Electron RCE primitive. `file:`, `javascript:`, and `data:` are also blocked, and URLs containing embedded whitespace or control characters are rejected before parsing. Added 11 regression tests in `shared/url-safety.test.ts`.
- `MarkdownPreview` rendering pipeline was hardened end-to-end. The pipeline now escapes raw HTML in the input *before* applying inline transforms (code blocks and Mermaid SVG are stashed behind placeholders and restored after escaping, so trusted output isn't mangled), and `escapeHtml()` now also escapes `"` and `'`. Image, link, autolink, and bare-URL handlers all route through a new `safeMarkdownUrl()` validator that enforces a protocol allowlist (`http:`/`https:`/`mailto:`/`tel:` for links, `http:`/`https:` plus a narrow `data:image/<png|gif|jpe?g|webp>;base64,…` whitelist for images), rejects URLs containing control chars, whitespace, quotes, backticks, brackets, or backslashes, and HTML-escapes the result before interpolation. Closes XSS paths via `[x](javascript:alert(1))`, `![x](data:text/html,…)`, and broken-attribute injection like `[x](https://e.com" onload="alert(1))`.
- Replaced `execSync(`git ${args}`)` with `execFileSync('git', [...args])` in the CLI's git runner. User-controlled CLI options (`--ref`, `--since`, `--author`, `--base`, blame paths) no longer flow through a shell, so values containing `;`, `|`, `&`, backticks, or `$()` can't inject commands. Added 7 regression tests covering the no-shell contract.
- Migrated every remaining `electron/ipc/git.ts` IPC handler from `exec("git " + args)` to `execFile("git", [...args])`. Renderer-supplied branch names, file paths, commit messages, stash indices, and log counts can no longer inject shell commands via the git IPC bridge. The unsafe `runGit()` helper has been deleted; new `runGitOrEmpty()` mirrors the old graceful-degradation semantics for handlers that need them.
- `orion run --fix` now refuses to write to paths that escape the project root. Previously the parsed `---FILE: <path> ---` blocks from AI output were written without validation, so a compromised provider or prompt-injected error stream piped into `orion run` could overwrite arbitrary files (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`). The confirmation prompt now lists each target path so the user can spot anything unexpected. Added 10 regression tests.
- Fixed an XSS opening in `editorZones.ts` where the AI suggestion badge interpolated the model name into `innerHTML`; the label is now built with `textContent`.
- AI chat markdown link sanitization was hardened: `safeHref()` in `src/utils/aiChatMarkdown.ts` now rejects URLs containing control characters, whitespace, quotes, backticks, brackets, or backslashes in addition to enforcing the `http:`/`https:`/`mailto:`/`tel:` protocol allow-list. Closes injection paths like `[x](javascript:alert(1)" onload="alert(1))` that previously slipped past a protocol-only check.
- API response HTML previews in `ApiClientPanel` are now rendered inside a `sandbox=""` iframe with `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`. A malicious or compromised API can no longer execute scripts or fetch external resources in the renderer context when its body is previewed.
- Notebook HTML cell outputs (`NotebookPanel`) are now rendered inside a `sandbox=""` iframe with `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`. Shared `.ipynb` files containing embedded HTML output can no longer execute scripts against the IDE renderer's globals when opened.
- `customCSS` passed to `MarkdownPreview` is now sanitized before injection into both the live preview and the exported HTML. `@import` directives, `</style>` breakout attempts, `expression(...)` (legacy IE), and any `url(...)` that isn't a `data:` URI are stripped — closes CSS-based exfiltration via attribute-selector tricks and external resource fetches.

### Fixed
- Open Folder commands from the command palette, welcome tab, recent-folder list, and native app menu now all route through the shared workspace-open flow instead of only opening the OS picker or dispatching an unhandled event.
- Top-level `program.parseAsync(...)` now has a `.catch()` handler, so unhandled rejections from command handlers print a friendly error and exit 1 instead of dumping an unhandled-rejection warning.
- `FS_SEARCH` IPC handler: hoisted the regex out of the per-file loop (was rebuilding it for every file), dropped the unused `g` flag together with its fragile `lastIndex` reset, and now lets an invalid user regex reject the renderer promise instead of silently skipping every file.
- `orion search`: same regex hot-loop fix — dropped the `g` flag and removed the per-iteration `lastIndex` resets that were papering over its stateful semantics.

### Added
- Dependabot configuration for weekly npm and GitHub Actions updates, with minor/patch updates grouped into a single PR per ecosystem.
- `npm run typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`), wired into CI.
- CI workflows now declare `timeout-minutes`, least-privilege `permissions`, `concurrency` with cancel-in-progress, and npm caching in `actions/setup-node@v6`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `SECURITY.md` are now shipped in the published npm tarball via the `files` manifest.

### Changed
- AI chat markdown parsing was extracted from `AIChatWidget` into a shared `src/utils/aiChatMarkdown.ts` module. The widget no longer duplicates fenced-code-block detection: both call sites use `hasCodeBlock()` and the shared `CODE_BLOCK_REGEX`.
