## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0 (we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm))
- **npm** >= 9.0.0
- **Git**

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/orion.git
   cd orion
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

4. **Build the CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm run cli:build
   ```

5. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:cli
   ```

6. **Start the development server** (for the Electron IDE):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

To use AI features locally, configure at least one provider:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Claude models |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key for GPT models |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Host URL for local Ollama instance (default: `http://localhost:11434`) |

```

## Adding a New CLI Command

Follow these steps to add a new command to the Orion CLI:

### Step 1: Create the Command File

Create a new TypeScript file in `cli/commands/`:

```typescript
// cli/commands/my-command.ts
import { Command } from 'commander';

export function registerMyCommand(program: Command): void {
  program
    .command('my-command')
    .description('Brief description of what this command does')
    .option('-f, --flag <value>', 'description of the flag')
    .action(async (options) => {
      // Command implementation
    });
}
```

### Step 2: Register the Command

Import and register your command in the CLI entry point so it becomes available.

### Step 3: Add Tests

Create a corresponding test file:

```typescript
// tests/cli/my-command.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('my-command', () => {
  it('should do the expected thing', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Step 4: Build and Verify

```bash
npm run cli:build
node dist-cli/index.js my-command --help
npm run test:cli
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Rules

- **TypeScript** is required for all source files.
- Use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`), not CommonJS (`require`).
- Target **Node.js 18+** -- avoid APIs unavailable in Node 18.
- Prefer `async`/`await` over raw promises or callbacks.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions focused: each function should do one thing well.

### Formatting

- Use **2-space indentation**.
- Use **single quotes** for strings.
- Include **trailing commas** in multi-line structures.
- Add **semicolons** at the end of statements.

### File Organization

- One command per file in `cli/commands/`.
- Group related utilities into shared modules.
- Keep imports sorted: external packages first, then local modules.

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully in CLI commands.
- Provide clear, actionable error messages to the user.
- Use `process.exit(1)` for fatal errors, not thrown exceptions at the top level.

## Testing Requirements

### What to Test

- **All new CLI commands** must have corresponding tests.
- **Bug fixes** must include a regression test.
- **Edge cases**: empty input, invalid arguments, missing API keys.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all CLI tests
npm run test:cli

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test -- --watch

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/cli/my-command.test.ts
```

### Test Guidelines

- Use `describe` blocks to group related tests.
- Use clear `it` descriptions that explain the expected behavior.
- Mock external services (AI providers, network calls).
- Tests must pass on all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and Node.js versions (18, 20, 22).

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add my-command for doing X"
   ```

   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `refactor:` for refactoring
   - `test:` for adding or updating tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

3. **Ensure all checks pass:**
   ```bash
   npm run cli:build
   npm run test:cli
   ```

4. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

### Submitting the PR

1. Open a pull request against the `main` branch.
2. Fill out the PR template completely.
3. Link any related issues.
4. Wait for CI checks to pass.

### Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR, usually within a few days.
- Address any requested changes by pushing new commits to your branch.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

### After Merge

- Delete your feature branch.
- Pull the latest `main` to keep your fork up to date.
